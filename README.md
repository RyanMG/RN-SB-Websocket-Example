# RN-SB-Websocket-Example
A sample application detailing how to establish a websocket connection between a react native application and a spring boot back-end

I am developing my first native application, and as I research the peices I need to complete features, I am building them out as simple, focused applications which cover just the need of the feature in a whitebox environment. WHile I have previous experience working with websocket commication between a standard web application and a NodeJS server, doing the same in React Native and Spring Boot was something new, and felt like something I wanted to build and learn with in a stand alone application.

You wrote about how this all works, in the hope it will help others who are learning and using a similar stack. You can read that here: XXXXX

## Running the application
* This will require Java 21 and NodeJS ~20.
* In the `server` folder, `./gradlew bootRun` to boot up the server.
* In the client folder, `npm run start` to boot up expo. To test it property, open the application in two instances - the web, iOS and/or android.
